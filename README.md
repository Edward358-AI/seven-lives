### Update v0.2.1
- Bug fixes
- Better system for fault tolerance
- This is the bigger fix I was talking aboutâ€”now its complete, so yay!
- To break the bigger fix down into detail, I have now updated the code to work with more varied guesses from the user, or in other words, the user can input a more wider variety of guesses using combinations of letters, and the code will handle that much better. ***In earlier versions, the user had a limited field of input, and the updated update_clue() function can now work with much more. Let's take a look at how it works. So first, the update_clue() function looks at the guessed input (Note: the update_clue function only runs if the input is in the word). It also creates a new variable every time it is called, len_indices. This variable keeps count of the correct letters and at the end will be subtracted from unknown_letters. Once unknown_letters reaches 0, the game ends. Ok, back to what we were talking about. The function will first start a for loop that loops through each character in the guess (it has also become even smarter to use the built-in set() function to remove repeats in the guess). Then, it will use get_indices() to get the index (or indices) of the letter in the secret word. Afterwards, it loops through the indices returned as a result of running the get_indices. Here's the tricky part: If the user guesses the same letter, there's a backup system. The program will check if there is already a letter in the place. If there is, it will move onto the next index. If there isn't, it deletes the value at the index where the guessed letter should now go, and inserts the letter at the correct index. Len_indices will have 1 added to it. At the very end of the function, when everything has been run, it will subtract len_indices from unknown_letters and return unknown_letters.*** This is the big fix, and probably will be the biggest fix for a while.
